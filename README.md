# Bio-image Analysis with Python course
This repository contains training resources for Python beginners who want to dive into image processing with Python.
We start with python basics, dive into descriptive statistics for working with measurements and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting results.
Furthermore, we will process images with [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/) and [clEsperanto](https://github.com/clEsperanto/pyclesperanto_prototype).

Every lesson ends with an exercise and it is recommended to do it before moving on to the next lesson.

The material will develop between April and July 2021. Stay tuned for the later lessons.

## Feedback and support

If you have any questions, please open a thread on [image.sc](https://image.sc), put a link to the exercise where you want to ask a question about and tag "@haesleinhuepf".
